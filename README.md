Secure Email Exchange:

Academic Final Project – Networking and Communications Course

A secure email communication system designed to demonstrate client–server interaction, message handling, and foundational security concepts. The project simulates how email clients connect to a server, exchange messages, and manage stored email data, with an added focus on encrypted communication.

Overview:

This project implements a simplified secure email exchange platform where multiple clients communicate through a central server. It highlights reliable message transfer, structured data handling, and basic security mechanisms.
The system supports:

-Sending and receiving emails

-Viewing email lists and message details

-Saving and restoring email data

-Encrypted message exchange (implemented by team members)


Encryption Component:

The project includes an encryption layer to secure communication between clients and the server.
This portion of the system was implemented by other team members and demonstrates how encrypted channels can protect message confidentiality during transmission.

I was responsible for:

-Designing and implementing the user interface

-Developing the communication layer between client and server

-Implementing logic for saving, restoring, and reading:

    Email lists
    
    Email details
    
    Client data
    
-Ensuring smooth interaction between the UI and backend components
